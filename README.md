# Multi-Modal AI Chatbot with Streamlit, LangChain, and Mistral LLM

Welcome to the Multi-Modal AI Chatbot project! This innovative chatbot is designed to understand and interact with users through text, voice, and image inputs. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, our chatbot provides a versatile and engaging user experience. Here's an overview of the technologies used:

- **Streamlit**: A powerful framework for building interactive and web-based data applications quickly and with minimal effort. Learn more at [Streamlit's official website](https://www.streamlit.io/).

- **LangChain**: An open-source library that facilitates building applications with language models, making it easier to integrate advanced natural language processing features. Check out LangChain on [Langchain-ai GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain).

- **Mistral LLM**: Enhances the chatbot's ability to understand and generate human-like text responses, providing a more intuitive interaction experience for users.
